## Release v7.0.0 - 2020-06-21

New with this release: Vault secrets can now be injected right into environment variables. Only **static** secrets are supported at the moment. Along with this feature, the `secrets` volumeMount is now automatically injected in your containers if not already defined (as it was the case with the `secrets` volume).

Default Vault image is now set to `1.4.2` to fix several CVEs (CVE-2020-13223, CVE-2020-12757: see HashiCorp's [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#142-may-21st-2020)).

Finally, the webhook certificates are no more generated using the Kubernetes Certificates API. The certificates and associated private key are now either generated by code or read from a Kubernetes Secret you provide. Refer to the updated [documentation](https://github.com/Talend/vault-sidecar-injector/blob/master/doc/Deploy.md#webhook-certificates) for details.
